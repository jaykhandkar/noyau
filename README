Hobby kernel for AMD64.
-> Uses a 32 bit multiboot compliant bootstrap/loader to load the 64
   bit kernel elf, enables long mode and jumps to the entry point.
-> Loader encourages a higher-half kernel lying at -128TB (fixed) in
   the 64 bit (canonical) virtual address space.
-> Uses PSF1 fonts and the framebuffer received from multiboot to
   print to the screen.

To build, a gcc toolchain for the targets i686-elf and x86_64-elf is
required. gcc 11.2.0 and binutils 2.37 are known to work.

-> The target all will build both loader and kernel.
-> The target image will generate a bootable iso image.
-> The target run will launch qemu with the iso image.
